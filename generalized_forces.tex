\section{Generalized Forces}
A generalized force is a force acting along with the generalized coordinate.
\\
\\
In a system described by generalized coordinates $q_i$, the generalized forces $Q_i$ are defined such that they account for the work done by all the actual forces acting on the system.
\subsection{Work in Generalized Coordinates}
The virtual work \( \delta W \) done by generalized forces \( Q_i \) during virtual displacements \( \delta q_i \) is given by:
\[
\delta W =  Q_i \delta q_i
\]


\subsection{Work by Physical Forces}
For a system with physical forces \( \mathbf{F}_j \) acting at points with positions \( \mathbf{p}_j \), the virtual work done by these forces is:
\[
\delta W = \mathbf{F}_j^T \delta \mathbf{p}_j
\]


\subsection{Displacement}
The displacement \( \delta \mathbf{p}_j \) of the point \( \mathbf{p}_j \) can be expressed in terms of the virtual displacements in the generalized coordinates \( \delta q_i \):
\[
\delta \mathbf{p}_j = \sum_{i} \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}_j}{\partial q_i} \delta q_i
\]


\subsection{Generalized Forces in Terms of Physical Forces}
Substituting \( \delta \mathbf{p}_j \) into the expression for virtual work:
\[
\delta W = \mathbf{F}_j^T \left( \sum_{i} \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}_j}{\partial q_i} \delta q_i \right)
\]

Comparing with the generalized virtual work expression, we identify the generalized forces:
\[
Q_{ij} = \mathbf{F}_j^T \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}_j}{\partial q_i}
\]
$i$: index of generalized coordinates 
\\
$j$: index of applied forces
