\section{Generalized coordinates}
The generalized coordinates $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geq \text{DOF}$. DOF is degrees of freedom, and is the number of independent coordinates needed to describe the configuration of a system. The generalized coordinates are not unique, and can be chosen in many ways. The choice of generalized coordinates is important, as it can simplify the equations of motion. The generalized velocities $\dot{\mathbf{q}}$ are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates. The generalized accelerations $\ddot{\mathbf{q}}$ are the time derivatives of the generalized velocities. The generalized forces $\mathbf{Q}$ are the forces that act on the system.
